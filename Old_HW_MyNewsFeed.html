Those social media footprints lead other Somali youths to follow optimistically thinking there is a guarantee to a better life in the West."

With optimism and hope of finding a better life in the West, Somali refugees will leave almost everything behind to make the journey. And, the ban has left refugees who were prepared to make Tahriib vulnerable to extremist groups suspicious of their motives for migrating to the U.S. Al Shabab, which has an influence around camps suspects migrants of providing intelligence information to authorities in the West. This puts lives at risk, which has amplified after the Trump ban leaving many Somalis grounded and surrounded by danger."

It opens with a scene that takes place in a resettlement center, which is usually the starting point for migrants from Somalia coming to Canada. And, the scene carries through to explain the significance of resettlement centers to the refugees who arrive, and is seen as their first home in a region that they will soon learn to call home whether temporarily or permanently. The resettlement centers serve at a learning facility on how to assimilate into a Canadian way of life for people coming for the first time."
